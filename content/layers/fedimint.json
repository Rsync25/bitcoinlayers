            "content": "Fedimint are a module based system for building federated appliations. They are currently focused on building federted ecash mints, which would offer improved privacy for peer-to-peer payments. The construction of a Fedimint sees users lock their BTC into a Federation's multi-sig, and receive an Ecash IOU representing the BTC in the Federation. Fedimints are also useful for community custody, an idea that sees users trust members of their local community (e.g. family members) with the custody of their Bitcoin assets."

Alice would respond by checking the ecash notes it holds, select the notes to equal the amount of the invoice, and then send them to Bob. Bob, containing the new notes, would send them to the guardians of the federation to redeem new ecash notes. This would see the transaction settled."
            "content": "Federations can also have a specifc user, or guardian, run a lightning node and pay lightning invoices on behalf of other users. In this model, Bob would receive an invoice from Alice. Bob would then create an equivalent invoice and broadcast that to the lightning node operator(s) in the federation. Bob would also include a service fee to incentivize the lightning node operators to pay the invoice on his behalf."

While this doesn't see users inherit any security directly, because they are still trusting members of a federation, it does ensure that the node operators inherit security from the Bitcoin network. This is useful because Bitcoin's consistent uptime ensures that the Fedimint node operators would also inherit Bitcoin's liveness, which is helpful for users."
