They have launched as a rollup on top of Ethereum, with plans to derive more security from Bitcoin miners, and full nodes, over time. Its relation to Bitcoin, currently, is similar to that of a sidechain as it is an alternative consensus protocol with a two-way peg(s) between it and the Bitcoin mainchain."

They also trust a variety of consensus participants to secure two-way pegs custodying the BTC.\nBOB primarily uses two BTC synthetics on its chain, tBTC and wBTC. Both are ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. tBTC’s two-way peg on BOB is managed by a ⅗ multi-sig, but it can be upgraded to allow Threshold governance to manage the minting and burning of tBTC on BOB. Threshold governance relies on a separate token and consensus mechanism. wBTC is effectively managed by a centralized custodian, BitGo. Currently, both of these tokens are minted on BOB via its native Ethereum bridge.\nUsers trust that the bridge operators will not steal their BTC, the BOB proposer to not publish a malicious, unchallenged state transition, or BOB’s proxy admin to create a malicious smart contract upgrade.\nIn the event of a malicious smart contract upgrade, there is no exit window for BOB users. This is the same across all chains built on the OP Stack."

In this design, the BOB sequencer would create rollup blocks, and the miners would validate that the blocks were created correctly. Miners would then give the blocks “Proof-of-Work” validation so they can be executed. This Proof-of-Work validation would take minutes, so it can also act as a soft finalization mechanism as OP Stack chains typically take 7 days for the challenge period to finalize."
